# flat-admin-v3-for-laravel
Flat Admin v.3 theme adaptation for *Laravel Framework 5.3*

## How to use it

First, create a Laravel 5.3 Project, with the command:

```
laravel new project_name
```

After the project is created, make the Auth (because this theme adaptation is for the Dashboard, and it needs Auth). Run the command inside the project folder:

```
php artisan make:auth
```

And, finally, download this repositorie (ZIP or clone), and copy the *public* and *resources* folder inside your project folder. Confirm the file overwrites.

Clear the compiled views:

```
php artisan view:clear
```

Now you can run your project with:

```
php artisan serve
```

Enjoy the theme!!!
